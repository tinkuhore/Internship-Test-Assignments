    "- **The objective of this assignment is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify various product and brand names from input images.**\n",
    "- The model should be capable of identifying the following brands: ***Saslic, 8X shampoo, WoW skincare, Head & Shoulder, P&G, Dove, L'Oreal, and Mamaearth.***\n",
    "- Sample product images have been provided for three of the brands, namely Saslic, 8X shampoo, and WoW skincare. However, the data sets for the remaining five brands must be collected manually by the candidate. These data sets should consist of various product images for each brand."
